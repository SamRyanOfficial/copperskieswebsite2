    text: "We used Sam and James and we honestly could not recommend them highly enough. Our guests are RAVING about them and we had the dancefloor of our dreams. Sam and James had never played at our venue before (Mudbrick on Waiheke) but you would never ever know. They were timely, set up efficiently and in perfect locations and worked with our other vendors like they had done so before. Both Sam and James interacted with our guests / the crowd so well and they played without a break â€“ switching between the two of them to change things up every now and then. We have minimal guidance on the song choices, they just read the crowd and sang what they thought would work best â€“ they ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT. I have to confess we got slightly cold feet in the lead up to the wedding because Sam and James' demo clips show that they are quite country focussed and we also weren't sure whether it would be better to go with a DJ so people could dance to the original versions of the songs. HOWEVER thank god we didn't change â€“ those demos do not do them any justice at all. They sang a huge variety of songs, not just country, and their voices are incredible. They can do it all â€“ they played during our ceremony while we signed the paperwork, after our ceremony during a cocktail hour and then for hours with a cranking dancefloor. They looked like they had lots of fun and wanted to be there, which made everyone feel really good. If you can't tell alreadyâ€¦ do not hesitate to book these guys!! Thanks Jan, Sam and James for giving us the night of our lives!",

They covered a good mix of classics and modern covers and kept the dance floor going well into the night. I'd highly recommend them for any event!",

    text: "Sam & James were just the ticket for our big party. It ended up with mostly overseas guests on the dance floor so they didn't know a bunch of the kiwi classics but Sam & James flexed perfectly to find tunes to please the crowd. We enjoyed every minute. Please pass on our thanks to Sam & James for helping make our wedding day the spectacular day it was. Our hope for an active dance floor was well and truly met thanks to them! We will definitely be recommending them to our friends.",

They brought so much fun and energy to their performance we'll definitely use them again in the future. It was such a fantastic evening and that's all down to Sam and James and their ability to engage with the audience. We would highly recommend them to anyone looking for memorable entertainment ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ",

They were interactive and energetic and had everyone on the dance floor the whole night! All our family and friends were raving about them, they loved all the music they played and dancing the night away! We highly recommend Sam & James for any event!

    text: "Sam and James are the best band you will ever book for an event. They played for us at our wedding this Feb and they exceeded all of our expectations. All the best songs and some epic country numbers. They learnt a song for us at pretty short notice and absolutely nailed it! Everyone was dancing from the first song till the very last. Nearly every person at our wedding has said how amazing the guys were. They've earned themselves a wedding party of groupies. Sam and James you were incredible! You made our wedding a night we'll never forget. One friend even said she had to put deep heat on her calves from dancing so much! If you want to sing and dance your heart out you have to book these guys! Thank you again!",

    text: "We had Sam and James and they were absolutely UNREAL! They really were one of the highlights of our wedding day and everyone has been raving about them since saying WOW your band! Who are they, we want them for our event! (very much looking forward to that). They bought the vibes, read the room and played awesome tunes and even took requests on the night from guests. Jake and I feel so stoked about how lucky we were to have such an incredible band play at our wedding! The dance floor was non-stop packed and going off for 3 hours straight. Everyone has been asking for their names since our wedding day. Hands down, best wedding band ever. Such cool guys and easy to communicate with. They really want the guests and bride/groom to have the time of their lives. They even let me sing my fav song, Man I feel Like a Woman up on stage.. Looking forward to listening to them again when they play at bars around Tauranga.",

You know it's a great wedding when people come away with sore feet from dancing the whole night. We were so so so happy with the vibe they created and their talent is incredible. I'm gutted we were away for photos and couldn't enjoy the acoustic music during canapÃ©s as it sounded so good! So many compliments from everyone who attended. Would highly recommend them to everyone.",

    text: "Sam and James played for our wedding and what a treat! Right from the start they were easy to communicate with and just genuinely nice guys. After hearing a few YouTube videos of them play we were excited but in no way did we expect what we got. They read the crowd and the dance floor was never empty, they were absolutely fantastic! Our guests were raving about them and a few commented about booking them for their event. (We can't wait). Thank you both for making it such a special, memorable evening. Felt like we were partying the night away with old friends. (Even the neighbours wanted to come and join in) Thanks again guys and hopefully see you soon!",

They were incredibly lovely and brought the most wonderful atmosphere to our reception. They were both super professional and made the entire process leading up to the wedding stress free. Our friends and family absolutely raved about them afterwards and continue to say they were just the perfect end to a perfect day. We can't thank you both enough for making our wedding night the best night of our lives â€” thank you so much!!",
